# Robo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DaveTrussel/robo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DaveTrussel/robo)

This project is intended to provide a simple interface to model robotic manipulators. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Dependencies

Depends on the Eigen library (for now still in the repo)

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Basic sage
Explain how to use it

```
Give an example
```

## TODO
- Basic model (Frames, Joints, Links, Chain)
- Forward Kinematics (joint coordinates to cartesian coordinates)
- Inverse Kinematics (cartesian coordinates to joint coordinates)
- Dynamic Model (Positions, Velocities, Torques -> Accelerations)
- Inverse Dynamic Model (Positions, Velocities, Accelerations -> Torques)
